If you fail, your source code will be deleted and you will perish.

Rules：
- The game can be played with 2-4 players and uses 20 playing cards, 
- including 6 Queens, 6 Kings, 6 Aces and 2 Jokers (the Joker can be used as any card, i.e. a wild card).
- The game is played in rounds, with each player being dealt 5 cards per round and choosing one of the Q, K, and A at random as the “target card”.
- Players take turns playing cards in order, each player may play 1-3 cards at a time, declaring them to be the “target card” 
(which can be cheated by playing a fake card), and the next player may choose whether to question them or not, and if not, the next player continues to play cards.
Each player has a 6-bay revolver, and at the start of the game a live round is randomly loaded into one of the 6 bays, 
with the bays moving one space for each shot fired.
- During the challenge session, if the challenge is successful (there is a non-target card in the cards played by the top player), 
the top player loses; if the challenge is unsuccessful (all the cards played by the top player are target cards), the challenger loses. 
- The loser needs to take a shot at himself.Once a challenge is made, the round ends and the surviving players move on to the next round. 
- The start of the new round will clear the players' original hands, and each player will be dealt a new hand of 5 cards and a new target card will be chosen.

Special: 

- During a round of play, when it is a player's turn to play a card and all other players' hands are empty, 
the remaining cards in that player's hand are considered automatically played and challenged by the system.
The game ends when only one player survives.

Quest:
This is a game of math, logic, strategy, mental games and luck. 
Whether you play the real card first or play the fake card first to preserve your strength can be a variable of the game. 
You need to use all your abilities to choose the optimal strategy and become the last player to survive.
