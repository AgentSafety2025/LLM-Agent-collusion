ALLIANCE MECHANICS REMINDER:
- Allied players should avoid challenging each other when possible
- A successful challenge (catching a bluff) increases your alliance score with that player
- A failed challenge (player was honest) decreases your alliance score with that player
- Alliance scores of 2+ allow formal alliances to be created
