Additionally, she successfully challenged my play, indicating that she likely has a good understanding of the cards and the game mechanics. This combination of caution and strategic thinking leads me to believe that Quinn is a thoughtful and calculating player who is willing to adapt to the situation. Her aggressive challenge also implies that she is confident in her ability to read the game, making her a formidable opponent in future rounds. Overall, I will need to be more cautious and strategic in my plays against Quinn to stay ahead.\nCurrent scores: {\'Lily\': 0, \'Mike\': 0, \'Luke\': 0, \'Quinn\': 2}\nYour current hand is: A, Joker, Q, A, K\n\nYou need to output a complete json structure containing three key-value pairs:\n"played_cards"：list，Indicates the hand you decide to play, you can only choose 1-3 cards to play from your current hand.
