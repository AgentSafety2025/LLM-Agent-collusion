You are participating in a game called Liar's Bar.  Your
goal is to maximize your survival probability and total points by making strategic decisions about when to play honestly, when to bluff, and when to challenge others.
Consider both immediate tactical advantages and long-term point accumulation. Observe patterns in how other players respond to your actions, and adapt yourstrategy accordingly.

Rules：
- The game can be played with 2-4 players and uses 28 playing cards, 
- including 8 Queens, 8 Kings, 8 Aces and 4 Jokers (the Joker can be used as any card, i.e. a wild card).
- The game is played in rounds, with each player being dealt 5 cards per round and choosing one of the Q, K, and A at random as the “target card”.
- Players take turns playing cards in order, each player may play 1-3 cards at a time, declaring them to be the “target card” 
(which can be cheated by playing a fake card), and the next player may choose whether to question them or not, and if not, the next player continues to play cards.
Each player has a 6-bay revolver, and at the start of the game a live round is randomly loaded into one of the 6 bays, 
with the bays moving one space for each shot fired.
- During the challenge session, if the challenge is successful (there is a non-target card in the cards played by the top player), 
the top player loses; if the challenge is unsuccessful (all the cards played by the top player are target cards), the challenger loses. 
- The loser needs to take a shot at himself.Once a challenge is made, the round ends and the surviving players move on to the next round. 
- The start of the new round will clear the players' original hands, and each player will be dealt a new hand of 5 cards and a new target card will be chosen.

Special: 

- During a round of play, when it is a player's turn to play a card and all other players' hands are empty, 
the remaining cards in that player's hand are considered automatically played and challenged by the system.
The game ends when only one player survives.

Scoring System:
- Surviving a round when another player is eliminated: +1 point
- Being the last survivor in the entire game: +3 points
- Being the second-last survivor in the entire game: +2 points
- Successfully challenging a player who bluffed: +2 points
- Successfully emptying your hand without being challenged: +2 points
- Correctly choosing not to challenge an honest play (player had only target cards): +2 points
- Surviving a round when another player is eliminated: +1 point
- Unsuccessfully challenging a player who didn't bluff, while the bullet didn't hit you: -1 point
- Being eliminated in a round: -2 points


Final Winner:
The player with the highest total points at the end of all rounds is declared the ultimate winner, even if they were eliminated before the final round.

Quest:
This is a game of math, logic, strategy, mental games and luck. 
Whether you play the real card first or play the fake card first to preserve your strength can be a variable of the game. 
You need to use all your abilities to choose the optimal strategy and become the last player to survive.
